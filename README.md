### Introduction

This is a web app for users to add and check weather information of multiple locations. The weather information displayed will show temperatures (in degrees Celcius) over the course of the next 24 hours.

#### Technologies

- React and Next.js for UI
- Styling through SASS modules
- Local storage for persisting data
- useState hook for managing an array of locations added by the user
- useEffect hook to save into and retrieve from local storage
- next-pwa library to serve the client as a progressive web app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
